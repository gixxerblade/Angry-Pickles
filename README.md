## Getting Started

1. Create a site with Gatsby

`gatsby new <project-name> https://github.com/gixxerblade/Angry-Pickles`

2.Setup Stripe

Create your Products within Stripe. Each Product should have at least one Sku.

The GraphQL query in the `ProductsProvider` lists the properties that Gatsby will expect to find on your Products & Skus. The `localFiles` field is created by `gatsby-source-stripe`, and `fields.slug` is created by the starter in `gatsby-node`.

3.Configure API keys

Rename .env.development.sample to .env.development and fill with your Stripe API test keys. Do the same for .env.production and your live API keys. Don't commit these files to a public repo!

4.Start development servers

There are two development servers for this project:

`gatsby serve` for our Gatsby site
`netlify-lambda serve functions` for our Netlify Functions
You will probably want to start both at once:

`npm run start`

Your site is accessible at `http://localhost:8000` and your Netlify Functions are accessible at `http://localhost:8000/.netlify/`.

Note: try deleting the cache (rm -rf .cache) if Gatsby's dev server fails to start.

Start developing

The source files for Netlify Functions are located at /src/functions, they are then built into the files in /functions. Visit the documentation for more information on their structure.

The `ProductsProvider` & `CartProvider` components centralize data & logic, which are then passed through React's Context API. The starter's components are written using Hooks.

Deploy to Netlify

If you want to deploy somewhere other than Netlify, you'll have to find another place to deploy the serverless functions in `/functions`, ex. AWS Lambda.
