        <p>USPS Priority Mail is used for all shipments.</p>
        <h2>Processing time</h2>
        <p>
          The time I need to prepare an order for shipping varies. For details,
          see individual items. Generally, you can expect your items processed
          to ship within 3â€“5 days.
        </p>
        <h2>Estimated shipping times</h2>
        <p>North America: 3-5 business days</p>
        <p>
          I'll do my best to meet these shipping estimates, but cannot guarantee
          them. Actual delivery time will depend on the shipping method you
          choose.
        </p>
        <h2>Customs and import taxes</h2>
        <p>
          Buyers are responsible for any customs and import taxes that may
          apply. I'm not responsible for delays due to customs.

        <h3>Are your pickles gluten free?</h3>
        <p>
          A pickle is a cucumber that has been soaked in a briny solution to
          make it sour. Whether pickles are gluten free is sometimes questioned
          because they are made with vinegar and the safety of vinegar has been
          questioned in the past. The vinegar we use is distilled and is gluten
          free so the pickles are too.&nbsp;<br/>
