Retired Marine Corps veteran Stephen Clark regularly cans the vegetables from his garden, so pickled cucumbers were a natural extension of that passion. Giving canned goods to his friends as gifts, Stephen has been told time and time again that he made pickles to die for. During a large local event, Stephen was asked to mass produce his pickle recipe for 600 cyclists; to give them something they would enjoy and would make their event memorable. The result was the original Angry Pickle that was enjoyed by all. We hope to bring this awesome taste to your home. Angry Pickles uses fresh in-season produce, from various locations. We even grow a small selection of produce in our backyard. We want to give our customers crisp, crunchy and delicious pickled vegetables. Most of all, we want to expand people’s palates and give you the best pickle you’ve ever had.
